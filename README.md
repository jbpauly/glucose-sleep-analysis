# Metabolic Health and Sleep Cross Analysis

Sleep, or lack of, can highly impact your metabolic health.
If you track your sleep with Whoop and glucose with Levels, 
this [app](https://share.streamlit.io/jbpauly/glucose-sleep-analysis/main/src/app.py)
enables you to cross analyze your sleep metrics glucose data.

## Try it out!
1. [Launch the app](https://share.streamlit.io/jbpauly/glucose-sleep-analysis/main/src/app.py)
2. Download your [Freestyle Libre glucose data](https://www.libreview.com/)
3. Download your [Whoop sleep summary data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q9tU4tkBLUi6oFsdLsO9HnOuMC-TEkrBXNoNXvLQt3Q/edit#gid=1913656685)
    - Follow the [How To video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x19G39cXkoM)
    - Download **only** the 'Whoop' sheet as a CSV

#### Learn more about the [Whoop api](https://github.com/pelo-tech/whoop-api-spec)
Thank you [Pelo-Tech](https://github.com/pelo-tech) and [DovOps](https://github.com/DovOps)
for creating the api and GUI!

## How to run in your own environment
The app requires Python 3.7. **Create a new virtual environment**, then run:

```
git clone https://github.com/jbpauly/glucose-sleep-analysis.git
cd glucose-sleep-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd src
streamlit run main.py
```

## Roadmap
1. Close out code coverage with tests.
2. Add data dictionary and clean up parameter names.
3. Calculate previous day strain metrics.
4. Investigate how the FreeStyle Libre device historizes data (on change vs interval) and adjust aggregations if needed.
5. Add best-fit-line & clustering features
6. Integrate with [whoop-api-spec](https://github.com/pelo-tech/whoop-api-spec) 
so users can request Whoop sleep data directly from app instead using the [google-sheet GUI](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1q9tU4tkBLUi6oFsdLsO9HnOuMC-TEkrBXNoNXvLQt3Q/edit#gid=1913656685)
7. Add option to download analysis dataset.

## Questions, comments, or suggestions?
This app new and will likely break at some point. 
It has not be tested with a large number of unique datasets,
