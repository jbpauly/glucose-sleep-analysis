#### Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression
The OLS regression method is the baseline method for linear models.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares):
> OLS chooses the parameters of a linear function of a set of explanatory variables by the principle of least squares: 
> minimizing the sum of the squares of the differences between the observed  dependent variable 
>(values of the variable being observed) in the given dataset and those predicted by the linear function.

**A coefficient of determination (r<sup>2</sup>) factor can be used to 
describe the "goodness of fit" of the OLS regression models.**
