#### Coefficient of Determination (r<sup>2</sup>)
The coefficient of determination can be used to help explain of the variance in one factor with another.
It's well covered in the [Applied Regression Analysis](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat462/node/95/) course at PennState. 
>r<sup>2</sup>, is the regression sum of squares divided by the total sum of squares
>or alternatively one minus the ratio of the error sum of squares to the total sum of squares.
> - Since r2 is a proportion, it is always a number between 0 and 1.
> - If r2 = 1, all of the data points fall perfectly on the regression line. The predictor x accounts for all of the
> variation in y!
> - If r2 = 0, the estimated regression line is perfectly horizontal. The predictor x accounts for none of the
> variation in y!

How to interpret the coefficient:
> "r<sup>2</sup> ×100 percent of the variation in y is reduced by taking into account predictor x"
> 
> or:
> 
> "r<sup>2</sup> ×100 percent of the variation in y is "explained by" the variation in predictor x."

It's important to remember that the coefficient of determination can describe correlation, not causation. 
**X does not necessarily cause changes in Y, but it can be used as a predictor for Y.**
