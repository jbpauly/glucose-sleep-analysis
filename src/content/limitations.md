### Application Limitations
This is by no means a substitution for Levels, Zero Fasting, or Whoop.
It a supplemental tool, and there are limitations. 
For example, there are no fully supported APIs for any of the applications, 
and using this application will require manual downloads and logging.

Additionally, it's important to keep in mind that **correlation is not causation**,
and much of the data interpretation will be left to your discretion.

### Data Integrations
Levels, Zero, and Whoop are part of my current health stack.
If you use other applications, tools, services, etc. in your health stack,
feel free to request new integrations.
