Hey! Thanks for checking out my application. 
I hope you find it useful or it nudges you to learn more about your metabolic health.
[Levels](https://www.levelshealth.com/signup) is a fantastic program,
and they're just getting started.

As a data scientist, 
my experience is in time series analysis & industrial equipment/system optimization,
and I have an appetite for learning and building new things.

I'm currently exploring opportunities for my next role!
An early stage startup solving tough but impactful problems 
(like **Levels** & metabolic health!) 
is where I envision myself in the near future.
