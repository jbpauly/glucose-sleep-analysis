Hey! Thanks for checking out my application. 

I hope you find it useful or it nudges you to learn more about your metabolic health. 

[Levels](https://www.levelshealth.com/signup) is a fantastic program,
offers tremendous insights and eduction,
and they're [just getting started](https://www.levelshealth.com/blog/the-secret-levels-master-plan-just-between-you-and-me-cgm-glucose).

[Zero Fasting](https://www.zerofasting.com/) simplifies the fasting journey, 
is backed by [science](https://www.zerofasting.com/why-fasting) 
and led by top [experts](https://www.bigskyhealth.com/our-team) in longevity and wellness.

[Whoop](https://www.whoop.com/) monitors heart rate and provides personalized fitness, sleep, and recovery analytics.

Together, as my current health-tech stack, these tools and technology enable me to strengthen my metabolic fitness.

As a problem solver, 
my experience is in time series analysis, 
industrial equipment/system optimization, 
program and project management,
and I have an appetite for learning and building new things.

I'm currently exploring opportunities for my next role, and looking to help solve tough but impactful problems!
