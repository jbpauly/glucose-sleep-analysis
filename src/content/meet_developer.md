Hey! Thanks for checking out my application. 
I hope you find it useful or it nudges you to learn more about your metabolic health.
[Levels](https://www.levelshealth.com/signup) is a fantastic program,
and they're [just getting started](https://www.levelshealth.com/blog/levels-raises-12m-investment-round-improve-metabolic-health-wearables).

As a data scientist, 
my experience is in time series analysis & industrial equipment/system optimization,
and I have an appetite for learning and building new things.

I'm currently exploring opportunities for my next role, 
and looking to help solve tough but impactful problems (like metabolic health)!
