#### Pearson's Correlation Coefficient
The Pearson's Correlation Coefficient can be used to identify top level relationships between two continuous parameters.
**It is not an inference of causation.** 

From 
[Kent State University Libraries](https://libguides.library.kent.edu/SPSS/PearsonCorr): 

> The bivariate Pearson Correlation produces a sample correlation coefficient, r, 
> which measures the strength and direction of linear relationships between pairs of continuous variables. 
> By extension, the Pearson Correlation evaluates whether there is statistical evidence for a linear relationship
> among the same pairs of variables in the population.

The Pearson's Correlation Coefficient, r, is measured from -1 to 1. 

From [PennState Eberly College of Science](https://online.stat.psu.edu/stat501/node/659):
> - If r = -1, then there is a perfect negative linear relationship between x and y.
> - If r = 1, then there is a perfect positive linear relationship between x and y.
> - If r = 0, then there is no linear relationship between x and y.
