#### [Study 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747878/)
Impact of mild intensity (50% or 65% VO2 max) exercise on insulin sensitivity

**Result / Findings**:  
Single session of mild intensity exercise can significantly increase insulin sensitivity the next day

#### [Study 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5569266/)
Impact of aerobic exercise on metabolic health

**Result / Findings**:  
Moderate aerobic exercise for 30+ minutes, 3+ times per week, for 8+ weeks improves insulin resistance and glycemic control

#### [Study 3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3587394/)
Impact of high intensity training on metabolic health

**Result / Findings**:  
High intensity training improves fasting glucose and insulin sensitivity in as little as two weeks

#### [Study 4](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28408695/)
- Impact of exercise timing and frequency on metabolic health
- Comparison of 3 exercise regimens (all add up to 60 cumulative minutes)
    - Regimen 1: 20 minutes of jogging, 30 minutes before meals, 3 times per day
    - Regimen 2: 20 minutes of jogging, 30 minutes after meals, 3 times per day
    - Regimen 3: 3 minutes of jogging every 30 minutes, 20 times per day
    
**Result / Findings**:  
Short bursts of activity multiple times per day lowers glucose more than one big chunk of exercise once a day

#### [Study 5](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23803893/)
- Impact of exercise timing and frequency on metabolic health
- Comparison of 2 exercise regimens (all add up to 30 cumulative minutes)
    - Regimen 1: Single 30 minute walk
    - Regimen 2: 1:40 minute walks every 30 minutes throughout the day
    
**Result / Findings**:  
Short but frequent walking group was significantly more effective at reducing post-meal glucose peaks and insulin levels
