Intermittent Fasting (IF) is a technique used to broadly improve metabolic health. 
During extended periods of fasting, 
our bodies ["flip a metabolic switch"](https://www.zerofasting.com/intermittent-fasting-may-improve-metabolic-syndrome/)
from burning glucose to burning fatty acids and ketones. More from the same post by Zero Fasting:
> The metabolic switch typically takes place in a later phase of fasting, 
> when the glycogen stores contained in the liver are depleted and adipose tissue (fat) begins to increase fatty
> acids and glycerol. While the switch generally occurs between 12 and 36 hours after stopping eating, 
> it can depend upon the total liver glycogen content when the person started the fast, as well as the personâ€™s
> energy expenditures during the fast.
