#### [Study 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6627766/)
Impact of time restricted feeding (TRF) on metabolic health
- Two groups
    - Group 1: 6 hour feeding window (8am-2pm), TRF group
    - Group 2: 12 hour feeding window (8am-8pm), control group
- Overweight, non-diabetic individuals

**Result / Findings**:  
- Engaging in time restricted feeding for just 4 days can lower fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and mean glucose
 levels significantly 
- TRF group demonstrated lower post meal glucose spikes, despite eating the same meals

#### [Study 2](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/99309EE4738FC8BA4AB29843B44AC2C9/S0007114511006507a.pdf/div-class-title-effect-of-meal-timing-and-glycaemic-index-on-glucose-control-and-insulin-secretion-in-healthy-volunteers-div.pdf)
Relationship between time of day of eating and metabolic health

**Result / Findings**:  
Eating food later in the evening will cause significant increase in insulin and glucose levels compared to eating the same meal in the morning

#### [Study 3](https://casereports.bmj.com/content/casereports/2018/bcr-2017-221854.full.pdf)
Impact of IF on controlling type 2 diabetes
- 3 participants with type 2 diabetes
- 24 hour fasts 3-4 days per week

**Result / Findings**:  
- All participants meaningfully reversed diabetes in as little as 7 months
- One participant regained enough insulin sensitivity to get off high doses of insulin medication within 3 weeks
