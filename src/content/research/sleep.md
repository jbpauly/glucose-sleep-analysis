The Levels team has summarized the findings across multiple studies of the impact of sleep on health 
and metabolism into a few major points.

> - The average sleep duration has decreased from 9 hours per night 100 years ago, 
> to about 6.8 hours per night today
> - Sleep quality and quantity both impact metabolic health and glucose regulation
> - Even acute sleep deprivation can impair metabolic function. In one study, sleep-deprived participants cleared
> glucose out of their bloodstream 40% slower than when they were well-rested 
> - Poor sleep can increase your risk of developing type 2 diabetes

Interestingly, this is increased risk in type 2 diabetes in both over and under sleeping. 
The ideal duration of sleep on average is somewhere between 7 and 8 hours. 
The ADA [summarized these results over 9 studies](https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/38/3/529).
