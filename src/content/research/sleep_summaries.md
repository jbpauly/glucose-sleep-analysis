General impact of sleep on risk of chronic diseases  

**Result / Findings**:  
Consistent, quality, uninterrupted sleep is critical to preventing type 2 diabetes, 
obesity, heart disease, alzheimerâ€™s, stroke

#### [Study 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2084401/)
Relationship between sleep deprivation and metabolic health
- 11 healthy young men
- 6 nights of sleep deprivation (4 hours of sleep) followed by a week of 12 hours of sleep  

**Result / Findings**:  
- Rate of clearing sugar out of the bloodstream was 40% lower during the sleep deprivation period
- Metabolic profile during the sleep deprivation period resembled those of people with type 2 diabetes 

#### [Study 3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2084401/)
Relationship between sleep duration and metabolic health
- Comparison of short sleepers (<6.5 hrs sleep) 
and normal sleepers (7.5-8.5 hrs sleep)
- healthy, normal weight individuals

**Result / Findings**:  
- Short sleepers secrete 50% more insulin than normal sleepers to achieve similar glucose results
- Short sleepers at risk of developing insulin resistance 

#### [Study 4](https://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/38/3/529)
Relationship between sleep duration and risk of type 2 diabetes

**Result / Findings**:  
Subjects who reported interrupted sleep and difficulty maintaining sleep had double to triple the risk of developing type 2 diabetes

#### [Study 5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2084401/)
Relationship between sleep deprivation and glucose levels

**Result / Findings**:  
Sleep deprivation can trigger an increase in growth hormone which decreases glucose uptake by muscles, increasing blood 

#### [Study 6](https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/0003-4819-141-11-200412070-00008)
Relationship between sleep deprivation and appetite
- 12 healthy young men
- 2 days of restricted sleep

**Result / Findings**:  
- Increase in hunger and appetite for calorie-dense high-carbohydrate foods 
- Elevation of hunger hormones
- Decrease of satiety hormones

#### [Study 7](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19388962/)
Impact of REM sleep on glucose levels

**Result / Findings**:  
On average glucose levels decrease by 5% during REM phases of sleep
