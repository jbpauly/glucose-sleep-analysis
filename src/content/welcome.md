You track your metabolic health with [Levels](https://www.levelshealth.com/),
and your strain and recovery with [Whoop](https://www.whoop.com/), 
but you haven't unlocked the relationship between your sleep and glucose levels.
As you actively work on your metabolic fitness, 
it's important to understand the impact of environmental variables like sleep and stress, not just nutrition.

This application allows you to upload your glucose and sleep summary data and analyze the results for yourself.

### Current Limitations
This is by no means a substitution for Levels or Whoop.
It a supplemental tool, and there are limitations. 
For example, the tool does not currently filter out your strenuous exercise.
So, exercise related glucose events will be included in daily calculations.
